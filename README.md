### Working: ###
The proposed model works on head detection technique. On a brief note, the laser and ldr sensor pairs,are placed on the entrance of the classrooms/auditoriums/conference halls. When a person enters the room, the LDR1 is tripped first , followed by the second LDR. This is how the entry algorithm works, which is similar for exit strategy. The LED Lights of our model is controlled automatically according to the percentage of total seating capacity of the room. 

Suppose, a presence of 50% attendance in a conference room on a day. The electrical appliances of only first half of the conference room are activated, saving the energy for the rest of the room, for the complete hours of the conference.
Moreover, the lights, fans, and other eletrical appliances turn off automatically when everyone starts exiting the room, to prevent wastage of even slightest of energy. In the displayed model in Hackathon, we have displayed the idea with LEDs, and automation. Precise Counting and automated lighting which saves a great extent of energy (upto 45-55%) is the main attraction of the our HACK.
